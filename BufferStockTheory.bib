  title    = "An impossibility theorem for wealth in heterogeneous-agent models
              with limited heterogeneity",
  author   = "Stachurski, John and Toda, Alexis Akira",
  abstract = "It has been conjectured that canonical Bewley--Huggett--Aiyagari
              heterogeneous-agent models cannot explain the joint distribution
              of income and wealth. The results stated below verify this
              conjecture and clarify its implications under very general
              conditions. We show in particular that if (i) agents are
              infinitely-lived, (ii) saving is risk-free, and (iii) agents have
              constant discount factors, then the wealth distribution inherits
              the tail behavior of income shocks (e.g., light-tailedness or the
              Pareto exponent). Our restrictions on utility require only that
              relative risk aversion is bounded, and a large variety of income
              processes are admitted. Our results show conclusively that it is
              necessary to go beyond standard models to explain the empirical
              fact that wealth is heavier-tailed than income. We demonstrate
              through examples that relaxing any of the above three conditions
              can generate Pareto tails.",

  abstract  = "Many issues in macroeconomics, such as the level of the steady
               state interest rate, or the dynamic effects of government
               deficit finance, depend crucially on the horizon of economic
               agents. This paper develops a simple analytical model in which
               such issues can be examined and in which the horizon of agents
               is a parameter which can be chosen arbitrarily.The first three
               sections of the paper characterize the dynamics and steady state
               of the economy in the absence of a government. The focus is on
               the effects of the horizon index on the economy. The paper
               clarifies in particular the separate roles of finite horizons
               and declining labor income through life in the determination of
               steady state interest rates.The next three sections study the
               effects and the role of fiscal policy.The focus is on the
               effects of deficit finance both in closed and open economies.
               The paper clarifies the respective roles of government spending,
               deficits and debt in the determination of interest rates.",

  abstract  = "In a model calibrated to match micro- and macroeconomic evidence
               on household income dynamics, we show that a modest degree of
               heterogeneity in household preferences or beliefs is sufficient
               to match empirical measures of wealth inequality in the United
               States. The heterogeneity-augmented model's predictions are
               consistent with microeconomic evidence that suggests that the
               annual marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is much larger than
               the roughly 0.04 implied by commonly used macroeconomic models
               (even ones including some heterogeneity). The high MPC arises
               because many consumers hold little wealth despite having a
               strong precautionary motive. Our model also plausibly predicts
               that the aggregate MPC can differ greatly depending on how the
               shock is distributed across households (depending, e.g., on
               their wealth, or employment status).",

               counterfactual permanent-income-neutral measure which
               incorporates the effect that permanent income shocks have on
               macroeconomic aggregates. With the permanent-income-neutral
               measure, one does not need to keep track of the permanent-income
               distribution. The permanent-income-neutral measure is both
               useful for the analytical characterization of aggregate
               consumption-savings behavior and for simulating numerical
               models. Furthermore, it is trivial to implement with a few lines

               wonderfully rich, expressive, and powerful theory of
               categories.'' --- The Math Association Category theory has
               provided the foundations for many of the twentieth century's
               greatest advances in pure mathematics. This concise, original
               text for a one-semester course on the subject is derived from
               courses that author Emily Riehl taught at Harvard and Johns
               Hopkins Universities. The treatment introduces the essential
               concepts of category theory: categories, functors, natural
               transformations, the Yoneda lemma, limits and colimits,
               adjunctions, monads, and other topics. Suitable for advanced
               undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text

               problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and
               algebraic topology. Drawing upon a broad range of mathematical
               examples from the categorical perspective, the author
               illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category
               theory arise from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas.

@ARTICLE{Deaton1991-vg,
  title     = "Saving and Liquidity Constraints",
  author    = "Deaton, Angus",
  abstract  = "[This paper is concerned with the theory of saving when
               consumers are not permitted to borrow, and with the ability of
               such a theory to account for some of the stylized facts of
               saving behavior. When consumers are relatively impatient, and
               when labor income is independently and identically distributed
               over time, assets act like a buffer stock, protecting
               consumption against bad draws of income. The precautionary
               demand for saving interacts with the borrowing constraints to
               provide a motive for holding assets. If the income process is
               positively autocorrelated, but stationary, assets are still used
               to buffer consumption, but do so less effectively and at a
               greater cost in terms of foregone consumption. In the limit,
               when labor income is a random walk, it is optimal for impatient
               liquidity constrained consumers simply to consume their incomes.
               As a consequence, a liquidity constrained representative agent
               cannot generate aggregate U.S. saving behavior if that agent
               receives aggregate labor income. Either there is no saving, when
               income is a random walk, or saving is contracyclical over the
               business cycle, when income changes are positively
               autocorrelated. However, in reality, microeconomic income
               processes do not resemble their average, and it is possible to
               construct a model of microeconomic saving under liquidity
               constraints which, at the aggregate level, reproduces many of
               the stylized facts in the actual data. While it is clear that
               many households are not liquidity constrained, and do not behave
               as described here, the models presented in the paper seem to
               account for important aspects of reality that are not explained
               by traditional life-cycle models.]",

               saving for retirement early in life; wealth is estimated to be
               far less sensitive to uncertainty than implied by that model.
               Instead, our results suggest that over most of their working

               `buffer-stock' models of saving described in Carroll (1992,

               features a steady-state that depends on initial conditions and
               equilibrium dynamics that possess a random walk component. A
               number of modifications to the standard model have been proposed
               to induce stationarity. This paper presents a quantitative
               comparison of these alternative approaches. Five different
               specifications are considered: (1) A model with an endogenous
               discount factor (Uzawa-type preferences); (2) a model with a
               debt-elastic interest-rate premium; (3) a model with convex
               portfolio adjustment costs; (4) a model with complete asset
               markets; and (5) a model without stationarity-inducing features.
               The main finding of the paper is that all models deliver
               virtually identical dynamics at business-cycle frequencies, as
               measured by unconditional second moments and impulse response

                 household income, wealth, and preference heterogeneity amplify
                 and propagate a macroeconomic shock. We focus on the U.S.
                 Great Recession of 2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First,
                 using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we
                 document the patterns of household income, consumption and
                 wealth inequality before and during the Great Recession. We
                 then investigate how households in different segments of the
                 wealth distribution were affected by income declines, and how
                 they changed their expenditures differentially during the
                 aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we study
                 several variants of a standard heterogeneous household model
                 with aggregate shocks and an endogenous cross-sectional wealth
                 distribution. Our key finding is that wealth inequality can
                 significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate shock, and it
                 does so if the distribution features a sufficiently large
                 fraction of households with very little net worth that sharply
                 increase their saving (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the
                 recession hits. We document that both these features are
                 observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role that social
                 insurance policies, such as unemployment insurance, play in
                 shaping the cross-sectional income and wealth distribution,
                 and through it, the dynamics of business cycles.",

               consumption expenditures in the presence of realistic labor
               income uncertainty. We employ synthetic cohort techniques and
               Consumer Expenditure Survey data to construct average
               age-profiles of consumption and income over the working lives of
               typical households across different education and occupation
               groups. The model fits the profiles quite well. In addition to
               providing reasonable estimates of the discount rate and risk
               aversion, we find that consumer behavior changes strikingly over
               the life cycle. Young consumers behave as buffer-stock agents.
               Around age 40, the typical household starts accumulating liquid
               assets for retirement and its behavior mimics more closely that
               of a certainty equivalent consumer. Our methodology provides a
               natural decomposition of saving and wealth into its
               precautionary and life-cycle components. Copyright The

               proportional to the sum of financial wealth and the present
               value of expected future income. The results help explain three
               important empirical consumption puzzles: excess sensitivity of
               consumption to transitory income, high growth of consumption in
               the presence of a low risk-free interest rate, and underspending
